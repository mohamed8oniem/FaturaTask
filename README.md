# Reflection

This was a 7 days long project built for a task purpose. Project goals included using technologies learned up and worked with it in real projects until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-dom`, `react-slick`, `bootstrap`, `axios`, `node-sass`,`react-lazy-load-image-component` and `react-spinners`.

One of the main challenges I ran into was Infinite Scroll and Favorite. This leads me to spend a few hours on a research spike into the best Lightweight node packages to implement that feature and finally, I decided to implement it manually using core javascript features.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 6, Axios, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and sass. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration, I plan on hand-rolling a project using the Vue.js framework to continue in my learning journey.
